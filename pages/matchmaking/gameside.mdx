# Game Side Integration

### Overview

### Step 1: Setting Up the Blueprint Nodes

Edgegap Matchmaker provides several Blueprint nodes to help integrate matchmaking into your game logic.

#### Key Nodes:
- Create Matchmaking Ticket: Use this node to submit a matchmaking request. This node will send player attributes (e.g., region, latency) to the matchmaker for processing.

- Get Matchmaking Ticket: This node reads the current status of the matchmaking ticket, providing information on whether a player is in queue, matched, or assigned to a server.

- Delete Matchmaking Ticket: If a player cancels matchmaking, this node will delete the matchmaking request from the system.

#### Example Blueprint Workflow:

1. Initiating Matchmaking:
    - Call the Create Matchmaking Ticket node when the player clicks "Find Match."
    - Pass relevant player attributes (e.g., game mode, latency) to the node.

Usually, the player attributes are stored in a JSON format. Here is an example of a player profile JSON object:
    
```json 
{
    "profile": "beta-test-profile",
    "attributes":
    {
        "elo_rating": 500,
        "selected_game_mode": "BattleRoyale",
        "latency":
        {
            "Dallas": 35
        },
        "selected_map": [
            "solomap"
        ],
        "selected_region": [
            "North America"
        ]
    }
}
```

In Unreal, using the Json library, you can convert this JSON object to a string and pass it to the Create Matchmaking Ticket node.

2. Polling for Match Status:
    - Use Get Matchmaking Ticket in a loop to check the status of the match. Once a match is found, transition the player to the assigned game server.

3. Canceling Matchmaking:
    - If the player cancels matchmaking, call Delete Matchmaking Ticket to remove the ticket from the queue.

### Step 2: Testing

Once your Blueprint logic is set up, test your matchmaking functionality by deploying servers via Edgegapâ€™s platform and ensuring players are correctly matched based on the rules defined in your configuration.
