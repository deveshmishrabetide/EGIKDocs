# Basics with Matchmaking Gen2

The Edgegap Matchmaker Gen2 is a state-of-the-art matchmaking system designed to simplify the process of pairing players in multiplayer games. Using advanced criteria and rule-based evaluations, the system can match players based on their attributes, ensuring a smooth and fair gameplay experience.

## How It Works:

Edgegapâ€™s Matchmaker pairs players based on a set of defined rules. You can set up profiles for different game modes (1v1, 2v2, ranked, etc.), ensuring that players are matched according to specific attributes like latency, region, or skill rating. The matchmaker can also be expanded to broaden search parameters if players are waiting too long.
